Questions vs Answers
====================

I've been doing an exercise lately where I would deliberately postpone trying to
answer some of the questions that I would have. Initially, the questions would be
leading in nature (the questions often came from a certain pre-held belief), 
but the exercise is to re-*mind* yourself to not (think you) know any answer(s), and to 
not even focus on potential answers. Instead, I'd spend dedicated time to note down
any further questions that would also come to mind when focusing on the initial question. 
I found that a surprising amount of questions would surface, one recursively 
leading to another, and that the pool of questions and the process itself had
significant effect on my perception of the initial question.

I am wondering whether the process can be used the to reflect on an 
essential question about this process itself. As a first "round" to see where this
could go as a collaborative piece:

1. reflect on the initial question in `questions.md`, but not in an attempt 
   to provide an answer - be mindful instead of any questions that arise.
2. note down *any* questions that appear in `questions.txt`.

Timebox and dedicate time for the process, without expectations about what 
will come to mind - as a creative process, let the mind wander.
